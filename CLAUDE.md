# wage-against-the-machine — purchasing power, 2016 → 2026

## What this is

A single-file static web app (`index.html`, no build step, vanilla JS) that answers:
"I earned X in 2016 — what do I need to earn now to be even?"

It gives four different answers, because they diverge sharply:

1. **Consumer prices** — what X needs to be to buy the same goods and services.
2. **Average pay** — what X would be if the user's pay had tracked their country's
   national average nominal wage growth.
3. **Housing** — what X needs to be to have the same house-buying power.
4. **Mortgage** — what X needs to be to make the same monthly payment on that same
   house, once the change in interest rates is priced in.

Country selector drives everything. Currency and number formatting follow the
selected country's locale. Country and salary are mirrored into the URL as `?c=&s=`.

## Architecture

Deliberately minimal. One file, no dependencies except Google Fonts.

- `DATA` object at the top of the `<script>` block is the single source of truth,
  fenced by `/* DATA:START */` and `/* DATA:END */` markers. Those markers are load
  bearing: `scripts/fetch-eurostat.mjs` finds, evaluates and rewrites the block
  between them. Don't remove them or change the field order casually.
- Every value is a cumulative % change, 2016 → 2026, except `rate16`/`rate26`, which
  are mortgage rates in % per annum.
- `render()` recalculates on any input change. No framework, no state library.
- The signature UI element is the **index ruler**: a horizontal scale where
  2016 = 100 and four markers sit at the resulting index levels. It's the fastest way
  to see that housing ran away from pay, and that financing ran away from housing.
  Don't replace it with a generic bar chart.

Design tokens are CSS custom properties in `:root`. Palette is deep petrol ink
(`--ink`) on sage-tinted paper (`--paper`), with three fixed data colours: green for
wages, ochre for prices, plum for homes. Those three colours are semantic — keep them
consistent anywhere new charts are added. The mortgage line is deliberately *not* a
fourth colour: it is plum, drawn hollow and dashed, because it is the housing line
seen through financing rather than an independent series.

## The mortgage model

`mortFactor = (1 + homes/100) × annuity(rate26) / annuity(rate16)`, where `annuity` is
the standard monthly payment per unit borrowed over `TERM_MONTHS` (300, a 25-year
repayment mortgage). It assumes the same house and an unchanged loan-to-value ratio, so
the deposit scales with the price and drops out of the ratio. Not modelled: fixation
periods, tax relief, fees, term differences between countries.

Mortgage rates are hand-maintained estimates in **every** country, including the ones
flagged `solid: true`. That's why the mortgage row always renders with `≈` regardless
of the country's flag, and why `scripts/fetch-eurostat.mjs` never touches `rate16` or
`rate26`. ECB MIR and national central banks are the sources to firm these up against.

## Data provenance — READ THIS BEFORE PUBLISHING

The `solid: true|false` flag on each country records whether prices/wages/homes came
from a published source or were compiled from annual rates.

**Sourced (`solid: true`):** US, Hungary, Romania, Estonia, Cyprus.
**Estimated (`solid: false`):** everything else. These render with `≈` in the table.
They are indicative, compiled by chaining published annual inflation rates and
approximating wage and house price series. They are good enough to show the shape of
the problem and not good enough to publish as fact.

Known-solid anchors, for regression-checking any refresh:

- US CPI-U, 2016 → 2026: **+39%** (BLS).
- UK CPI, same period: **+41.5%**.
- EU HICP, 2016 → 2025: **+33.0%** (Eurostat). Highest: Hungary +73.2%,
  Romania +61.8%, Estonia +61.3%. Lowest: Cyprus +19.5%.
- US Case-Shiller national index: ~184 in late 2016 → 335.1 in May 2026, so
  **≈ +80%**.
- OECD real average annual wages, 2016 → 2024 (constant PPP USD): US +10.6%,
  Canada +7.3%, Germany +3.0%, UK +2.9%, France +0.5%, Japan −0.6%, Italy −4.8%.

## Replacing the estimates

`scripts/fetch-eurostat.mjs` implements the build-time design: fetch, compute
2016 → latest cumulative changes, write the `DATA` object back into `index.html`. The
app stays a static file with zero runtime dependencies. Datasets used:

- `prc_hicp_aind` — HICP annual average index. Consumer prices.
- `prc_hpi_a` — house price index, annual, `purchase=TOTAL`. The script tries the
  2015 = 100 unit first and falls back to the 2010 and 2020 bases, because only the
  ratio latest / 2016 is ever used, so the index base is irrelevant.
- `lc_lci_r2_a` — labour cost index, for wages. This is a stand-in: OECD's "Average
  annual wages" is the better cross-country series but has no open REST API. If you
  want it, download and hand-edit those figures.

**Status: not yet verified against the live API.** It was written in a container with
`ec.europa.eu` blocked by an egress proxy, and tested end to end against a stubbed
JSON-stat response — parsing, unit fallbacks, skip rules, `solid` recomputation and
the file rewrite all round-trip correctly. The dataset parameter names are the part
that still needs a real run to confirm. Always `--dry-run` first.

Skips, and why:

- **US** is not in Eurostat at all. Its row is hand-sourced (BLS, Case-Shiller) and the
  script leaves it alone — including its `solid: true`, which is what the `"sourced"`
  vs `"estimate"` distinction in the script's `SKIP` table exists to protect.
- **Greece** has no transaction-based house price data in Eurostat; Bank of Greece
  valuation data is used for European aggregates. Its housing figure stays an estimate
  and the country stays `solid: false`.

## Other open items

- Averages hide distribution. Minimum wages rose much faster than average wages across
  Europe in this period, so low earners generally did better than these country
  averages imply. There is a note under the verdict; a median/minimum toggle would be
  better.
- Wages are gross. Tax wedges changed over the decade and are not modelled.
- Rent is not modelled at all — only purchase prices and the cost of financing them.
- Verified in headless Chromium at 1100px and 390px: no label overflow, no collisions,
  no console errors. Not yet checked on real devices.

## Deployment

Static single file. Netlify Drop, Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages, or Vercel all
take it as-is with no config. No server, no environment variables, no secrets.

## Tone

The subject is people losing ground. Copy should be plain and unsentimental —
state the number, don't editorialise about it. The existing `verdict` string is
the register to match.
